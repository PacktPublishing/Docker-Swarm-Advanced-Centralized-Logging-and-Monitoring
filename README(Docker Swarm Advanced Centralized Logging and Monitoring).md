# Docker Swarm Advanced: Centralized Logging and Monitoring [Video]
This is the code repository for [Docker Swarm Advanced: Centralized Logging and Monitoring [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/docker-swarm-advanced-centralized-logging-and-monitoring-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788395854), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
In this module, we explore Docker Swarm in depth. Now that we have a cluster up–and-running with many containers, it is quite hard to know what is going on.

To start, we are going to learn about the Docker Swarm Remote API. We will find out how to retrieve information from the cluster, and deploy and scale services using the API. Then we will look how to build our centralized logging and how to send data. To close we will learn how to search for logs using Kibana, and collect metrics to monitor containers running in the cluster. We will display this information in a Dashboard using Grafana, to clarify what is going on.

By the end, you will be able to use Docker Swarm Remove API, parse and send logs to a centralized place, and collect metrics and monitor your Docker Swarm cluster. We also d LinuxKit and how to build your custom image.
